# HTML-Code-for-begginers
This is a code for HTML website and I have created it to help others .It's a dummy website and to make it working you have to add JavaScript in it. Except text, I have added pictures, comment box and more. You can download it and if you want to view it's code then you have to open it with any of the app( in which you write codes).
